//! pentacle is a library for executing programs as sealed anonymous files on Linux, using
//! `memfd_create(2)`.
//!
//! This is useful for executing programs that execute untrusted programs with root permissions, or
//! ensuring a cryptographically-verified program is not tampered with after verification but
//! before execution.
//!
//! The library provides [a wrapper around `Command`][`SealedCommand`] as well as two helper
//! functions, [`ensure_sealed`] and [`is_sealed`], for programs that execute sealed versions of
//! themselves.
//!
//! ```
//! fn main() {
//!     pentacle::ensure_sealed().unwrap();
//!
//!     // The rest of your code
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Lower-level control over the creation and sealing of anonymous files is available via
//! [`SealOptions`].
